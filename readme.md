This project includes a docker-compose.yml file to handle local development. Do not include this file when updating the version on the server.  

This project is us gulp as the build tool. See below for the current tasks. Also, if you are running this in windows be sure to use node from ***command prompt*** instead of **WSL**. Gulp doesn't appear to detect file changes for the watch statement if you are running the watch task from WSL.
